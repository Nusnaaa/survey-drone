## Project Breakdown:
This project will proceed in two main, distinct phases:

### Phase 0: 
This phase will largely consist of my setting up the foundations for this project. I need to research the differen tools needed, read up on theory and formulate my initial deisgn parameters
1. Initial sizing
2. Research into drone design(refreshing myself on general aircraft design, researching battery considerations etc.)
3. Learning new software (FreeCad, OpenFoam etc)
4. Refamiliarising myself with python and other programming tools
5. Setting up github for version control

### Phase 1: Mechanical Design
This stage considers much of the content covered in my degree. This phase is concerned with everything from conceptual to detailed design for thhe mechanical and aeronautical parts of this project. I will consider some electrical/electronic components, but without learning electronic engineering, I cannot go too into detail at this stage.
1. Conceptual Design
2. Prem#liminary Design
3. Detailed Design
4. Prototyping - building scale models of the aircraft to assess whether the design needs to be tweaked before manufacture.

### Phase 1.5: Transition to Electronics
I am not too familiar with electrical/eectronic design so this phase will see me delve into the basics a learn the most foundational concepts I need to begin outlining and designind the electrical system's requirements such as the powertrain, avionics etc.

### Phase 2: Electronic Design
I believe the general process to design functioning electronics will proceed similarly to phase 1. I will fill in the specific steps and stages when I have better foundations in this field.
